        <br>
        I have found my true passion in programming.
        I love to solve challenges, whether it is navigating a robot to
        its destination using only Bluetooth, or recognizing printed digits on an image.
        Having a background in Computer Science and a great, hands-on experience as a
        Software QA Engineer intern at SessionM (the Boston start-up), I help
        people to solve their problems by brainstorming, planning, and coding solutions.
