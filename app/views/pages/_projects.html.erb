        It is common for items such as keychains and remote TV controls to get lost.
        Time to find lost items can sometimes take hours. The solution
        to that problem is to attach a beacon to a keychain, and whenever
        the keychain is lost, a self-driving car robot can be deployed to find
        the lost item. Using Bluetooth as a connection medium between the robot
        and the beacon, robot will navigate an area to reach the beaconâ€™s position.

        Built as team project, ASK is part of a research at Wentworth Institute
        of Technology to make a cornhole-playing robot. The automatic score keeper
        predicts score for both players (utilizing computer vision library openCV),
        using an image or a video stream of a cornhole game. I've created the metrics
        tool to validate the software by comparing predictions with data from a dataset
        of cornhole game state images. ASK accomplished ~90% accuracy on color detection
        and ~85% accuracy on location detection (a bag on/off the board, or in the hole).

        Developed in the Intro to Artificial Intelligence course, Simplified Digit
        Recognition (SDR) is a tool that helps to recognize digits from an image without
        a lot of background noises. Used Python as the main language along with
        computer vision and machine learning libraries, training SVM classifier on
        the MNIST database. Achieved 91% accuracy on printed digits only, 85%
        accuracy on printed digits with other elements, and accuracy of
        approximately 70% on handwritten digits.
